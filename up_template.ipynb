    "The minimum requirements for an openLCA project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A database (.zolca or JSON-LD) with a product system that references a process, which is the unit process you wish to model.\n",
    "* Input and output product and elementary flows for the unit process.\n",

    "**Note:**  Additionally, report generation uses **[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)** to convert the generated report from markdown to formats such as .pdf, .docx, .html. If you intend on generating a report in within your session with this notebook, please make sure to install this tool on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above packages installed, the Jupyter Notebook environment may be started.\n",
    "The following provides a brief summary of instructions to get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a copy of this Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and give the new file a meaningful name (e.g., the product system / unit process name).\n",
    "1.  Move or copy your calculations workbook into the calculations directory.\n",
    "1.  Open the Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, on the terminal (or command line), type `jupyter lab` and use the File Browser to find your notebook file.\n",
    "    Double-click to open in Launcher.\n",
    "1.  Run the code cell found in the Definitions section of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This loads all the source code necessary for running the template.\n",
    "1.  Run the code cell found in the Interface section of this notebook and follow the prompts to connect to a file ('1' &rarr; '1b') or to an openLCA project ('2' &rarr; '2b').\n",
    "\n",
    "    You will be prompted to select your unit process from the list of product systems found in your openLCA database or JSON-LD file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Once the unit process is selected, use the main menu to review report (option '3'), reselect your unit process (option 'o' &rarr; 'p'), and generate a report (option '4').\n",
    "    Note that the output report is, by default, saved to the \"output\" folder with the same name as the unit process you selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    At any time, just hit return (or Enter) on your keyboard for the main menu options.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each menu option has help text that you can request using the 'h' with the menu option in parentheses: 'h(1)' for help with connect.\n",
    "1.  Type 'q' anytime to quit the interface.\n",
    "1.  Save the notebook and shutdown the Jupyter Notebook server when you are finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refine your report:**\n",
    "If you find information missing (e.g., in the documentation section), you can make a report edit (i.e., not saved in the openLCA database or JSON-LD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The '4b' option in the interface generates a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted plain text file.\n",
    "This basic style is the foundation for each other report format (e.g., HTML, Microsoft Word, and PDF) and is easily edited in Jupyter Lab (or any text editor).\n",
    "Changes may be made to the markdown version of the report, saved, and used to generated other formats---even without connecting to an openLCA project or JSON-LD (assuming the markdown report already exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "The publication methods (e.g., '5a', '5b', and '5c') read the markdown file and convert them to their alternative file format using the NETL templates provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write to markdown again (e.g., '4b') all edits made to the markdown file outside this application will be overwritten!\n",
    "You can always see what is in the markdown file by printing the report ('4a').\n",
    "If you are running this app after you already created a markdown, and '4a' says you should write first, you can use '4c' to read the existing file without overwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If you have exited the interface section, you can open the .md file that was created and fix a typo or add missing information that you correct and save (e.g., ctrl+s or File &rarr; Save Markdown File).\n",
    "In a new code cell, you can run each of the following lines to generate a new HTML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> mc.rd.get_file_path()   # see where unit process file is\n",
    ">>> mc.rd.convert_to_html() # reads .md and translates to .html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:**\n",
    "Re-saving to markdown (option '4b') will overwrite any changes you made to the text file."
